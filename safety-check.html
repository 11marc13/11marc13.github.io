                    <p>Safety Check is a brand I conceptualized and developed to spread awareness of CTE and brain
                        trauma from playing ice hockey. Currently the National Hockey League (NHL) does not formally
                        recognize that you can get such long-term injuries from the sport, so this would be a charity
                        hockey game with money going towards CTE research. Players from the Eastern and Western
                        Conferences in the NHL would participate.</p>

                    <h2>Branding</h2>
                    <p>The name itself is a play on words in that throwing a hit in hockey is usually referred to as
                        "body check." There are two versions of the logo with one being on the home jersey and the other
                        on the away jersey. In the logo itself, the hockey stick doubles as a check mark with the cut
                        out shape in the stick tape being utilized as a design motif throughout the branding. </p>

                    <h2>Jersey Design</h2>
                    <p>Both uniforms feature an asymmetrical design with abstracted check mark pattern. The main
                        inspiration behind such a scrambled abstraction is due to how mentally scrambled one can become
                        when dealing with brain trauma. Shoulder patches represent whether you play in the Eastern or
                        Western Conference. The back of each jersey follows the asymmetrical motif with uneven number
                        placement and a curved-down nameplate. These elements act as a representation of a declining
                        mental state.</p>

                        featured on the laptop, where another play on words is used. In hockey, if you are shorthanded
                        that means you are playing with less players on the ice compared to your opponent; thus
                        significantly handicapping your team. Those living with CTE essentially feel like they are
                        living their life "shorthanded." Stylistically, the illustration of the player ties into what
                        some former players have said: living with CTE causes one to feel like a cut out of themselves.
                    </p>

                    <p>Displayed on the tablet are the symptoms of CTE in a layout similar to that of a standard hockey
                        team game lineup, where there are multiple lines with a left wing, center and right wing. That
                        cut out shape from the logo is utilized in different ways to represent each symptom.</p>
