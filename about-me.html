          <p>Hey there, I'm Marc Agnello. After graduating from Drexel University in 2020 with a Bachelor of Science in graphic design with minors in marketing and fine arts, I went on to work in a couple of different industries.</p>

          <p>First being in e-commerce at Hotels at Home, a digital marketing firm specializing in the hospitality sector. While there, I designed emails promoting products for various brands such as The Ritz-Carlton Hotel, W Hotel and Kimpton Hotels along with some web and package design.</p>

          <p>Second being performance marketing as the in-house marketing designer at SmartAsset, a fintech startup. As the only marketing designer for a majority of my tenure there, I worked with many different facets in the company. Mainly with the content marketing team where there was a focus on CRO (conversion rate optimization), I redesigned and coded landing pages with the purpose of conducting A/B tests to see which would perform better. A combination of new copy provided by a member of the marketing team and my redesign resulted in one such test achieving a 140% increase in CVR, while another resulted in a 38% increase.</p>

          <p>Those optimizations and design changes were implemented across a number of other landing pages to increase the performance at a larger scale and keep branding consistent. I also designed ads for the social media and native ad platform channels and similar to the landing pages, I would conceptualize new ideas to A/B test as well as ideate new campaign concepts.</p>

          <p>I also worked with the UX team to help establish brand guidelines for SmartAsset and ensured they were being followed by the rest of company and any outside vendors and agencies we worked with.</p>

          <p>On a more personal note, I’m a huge hockey fan and enjoy designing new jersey concepts for fun. When I'm not busy designing, you can try to catch me on the ice at the closest rink playing hockey or on a quiet block rollerblading in the street. If I'm not playing hockey, then I'm probably checking out a new brewery with friends.</p>

          <p>Well, that's a lot of words you just read through and I appreciate you making it this far. Feel free to read even more words by checking out my resume via the button below, or get in touch directly with my contact info in the footer!</p>
